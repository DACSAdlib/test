<h1>ISAD Definitions</h1>
<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title which appears prominently on or in the archival material being described.</em></p>
<h2>Supplied title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title supplied by the archivist for a unit of description which has no formal title. Title. A word, phrase, character, or group of characters that names a unit of description.</em></p>

<h1>RAD2 Definitions (Provided for context)</h1>
<h2>Supplied title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A Title provided for the Unit bening described that has no Formal Title. It may be taken from the archival material, from an external source, or it may be composed by the archivist</em></p>
<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The Title that appears prominently in or on the Chief Source of Information</em></p>

<h1>DACS Definitions</h1>
<h2>Devised title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A devised title is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described or when the formal title is misleading or inadequate.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>The rules for recording a devised title differ from the rules for recording a formal title. Archivists usually devise titles for archival materials</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Devised titles generally have two parts:</em></p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; name of the creator(s) or collector(s)</p>
<p class="contentindent3">&bull; nature of the materials being described</p>

<h2>Formal title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A formal title is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film). In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be devised. The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to devise a title rather than transcribe a label on a container that may be misleading. When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.</em></p>

<h2>Sources of Information</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>2.3.1 When devising a title, take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described, an external source such as a records schedule or communication with a donor, or a title on another copy or version of the materials being described.</p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>2.3.2 When recording a formal title, transcribe the information according to the appropriate standard. Some companion standards are suggested in Appendix B. Rules for transcribing formal titles are not provided here.</p>

<h2>DACS Statement concerning change in terminology</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>RDA rules for titles provided by archivists (“devised titles”) were in closer agreement with archival practices. DACS 2004 had used the term supplied for these titles, in alignment with ISAD(G). Recognizing the growing convergence between library, museum, and archival descriptive standards, and the predominant use of the term devised by companion archival standards to DACS, as well as the greater clarity of the term, the subcommittee has chosen to change the term supplied to devised. Finally, the subcommittee considers it important that the U.S. archival community
continue to monitor the development of RDA. Its reliance on entities and their linkages provides promise for informing the developing archival conceptual model and for greater cooperation between archives and libraries in the future.</em></p>

<h1>RDA Definitions</h1>
<h2>Devised title</h2>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>A title proper created by an agency preparing a description of a manifestation that bears no title itself and has no title associated with it that can be found in accompanying material, a published description of the manifestation, a reference source, etc</em> See also <a href="https://github.com/DACSAdlib/DACSAdlib/wiki/RDA-2.3.2.10-Manifestation-with-no-title#23211-recording-devised-titles">2.3.2.11 Recording Devised Titles</a></p>
<h2>Supplied and Formal Titles</h2>
<p class="contentindent2">Supplied titles are referred to indirectly in <a href="https://github.com/DACSAdlib/DACSAdlib/wiki/RDA-2.3.2.10-Manifestation-with-no-title#23210-manifestation-with-no-title">RDA 2.3.2.10 manifestation without a title</a> <em>If there is no title in the manifestation itself, record as a title proper ...  a title taken from another source</em></p>
<p class="contentindent2">Cataloguers are then directed to a list of appropriate sources</p>
<p class="contentindent2">Similiarly, the concept of a Formal Title is addressed in the section on <a href="https://github.com/DACSAdlib/DACSAdlib/wiki/RDA-2.2.2.-Preferred-Sources-of-Information#222-preferred-source-of-information">Preferred Sources of Information</a> at RDA 2.2.1.</p>

<h1>DCRM (G) (for context)</h1>
<p class="contentindent2">Within DCRM (G) neither suppplied, devised or formal titlest are included. However, there is an appendix detailing supplied and devised treatements</p>
<h2>Supplied and devised titles</h2>
<p class="content">Note that when using the BSR-RDA-MAP with DCRM (G) cataloguers are directed to RDA 2.3.2 for title proper</p>
<p class="contentindent1">1F1. Title supplied from another source</p>
<p class="contentindent1">1F1.1.</p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>If no title can be derived from text (printed, manuscript, or electronic) provided by the creator or creating body on or with the material, but a title can be supplied from another source, transcribe it from that source and enclose it in square brackets. Cite the source in a note.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent1">1F1.2.</p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>If no title can be derived from text (printed, manuscript, or electronic) provided by the creator or creating body on or with the material, and two or more sources disagree on the title, either in content or in language, and none can be credited with representing the creator’s intent, choose the title from an authoritative source and transcribe it in square brackets. If considered important, give additional title access to the variant titles.</em></p>
<p class="contentindent1">1F2. Cataloger-devised title for untitled material</p>
<p class="contentindent2"><em>If no title can be derived from text (printed, manuscript, or electronic) provided by the creator or creating body on or with the material, and a title cannot be supplied from the beginning words of text (see 1B5) or from another source (see 1F1), devise a brief descriptive title, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the title proper.</em></p>
