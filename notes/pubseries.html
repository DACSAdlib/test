<h1>Adlib - Notes and description control  -  Publisher Series</h1>
<p class="content">The purpose of this element is to provide the title and statement of responsibility of a publisher's series, where applicable.</p>

<h2>FIELD IS PROBLEMATIC</h2>
<p class="content">Requirement: See DQSS prior to use</p>
<p class="content">This field is not for entries concerning publications about the unit of description</p>
<p class="content">In RAD2 there is an entire section: 1.6 Publisher's series area</p>
<p class="content">In the ACMS draft manual Publisher's Series is treated as a 'Specialized Element'</p>
<p class="content">There is no equivalent instruction regarding this area in DACS, aside from a single reference in the <a href="https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/dacs/06_part_I/08_chapter_07/01_notes.html#71-notes-added-value">Notes area introduction</a>.</p>,

<p class="content">Ostensibly the field can be used as an access point, but it is does not function as this in Primo.</p>
<p class="content">Potentially the field could be linked to MARC 130 and/or 830 as function as a Uniform Title in Primo</p>
<p class="content">Something for CEP</p>
